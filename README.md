## Project Description
Chinese_song_recommender - In summary: user inputs a song. If the song is the Billboard Top100, the program will output another song from the Billboard top 100. If it isnÂ´t in the top 100, the program uses the spotify API to suggest you a chinese song from a random song someone decides to input.   Advanced methods used in this - clustering, kmeans.
